# Rails with React and Webpack

## A simple example to demonstrate a Rails application using React with Webpack.

The rails project is an API application that will be used to serve the data in a Json format.
The view was made in react, using babel to transpile and webpack to bundle / manager the modules.
The database used is Postgres.


To get the code:

`git clone https://github.com/QuickMonkeys/react-webpack-quick.git`

`cd react-webpack-quick`

run `npm i` to install node_modules

run `nf start -j Procfile.dev` to start the application using Foreman.

You can see a live [Demo](https://rails-react-webpack-quick.herokuapp.com/) here.
