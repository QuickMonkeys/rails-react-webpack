# Rails with React and Webpack

## A simple example to demonstrate a Rails application using React with Webpack.

The rails project is an API application that will be used for serve the data in a Json format.


To get the code:

`git clone https://github.com/QuickMonkeys/react-webpack-quick.git`

`cd react-webpack-quick`

run `npm i` to install node_modules

run `nf start` to start the application using Foreman.
